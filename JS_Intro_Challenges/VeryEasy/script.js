// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the 
// difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 
// is 4” 

// var number1 = 626;//Variable 1
// var number2 = 420; // Varriable 2
// console.log('The difference between ' + number1 + ' and ' + number2 + ' is ' + (number1 - number2));

const number1 = 300;
const number2 = 400;
console.log(`the difference between ${number2} and ${number1} is ${number2 - number1}`)
