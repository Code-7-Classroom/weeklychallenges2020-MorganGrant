// Var: Is a variable that the coder can be change/mutate as much as the user sees 
// fit and can accessed from any code block.

//Let: Is a lot like var in that it can be mutated and changed  an infinte number of times 
// but unlike var, it has scope, meaning it's only accesible in block of code it occupies.

//Const: Is a variable that cannot be changed.
