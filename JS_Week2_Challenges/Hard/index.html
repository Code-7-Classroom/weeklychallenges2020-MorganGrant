    <h1>JavaScript Week 2 Hard Challenge </h1>
    <p>
        HARD:
        Tom has a height of 9in and a mass 8lbs and Jerry has a height of 10cm and a mass of 45g. Compare the BMI’s of
        Tom & Jerry using the formula: BMI = mass / height ^2 = mass / (height * height).
        Given the information for Tom and Jerry. Store Tom & Jerry’s mass and height as variables. Calculate both
        their BMI’s. Create a Boolean variable containing information about whether Tom has a higher BMI than Jerry.
        Print a string to the console with the variable from step 3 ( e.g. Is Tom’s BMI higher than Jerry’s? false).
